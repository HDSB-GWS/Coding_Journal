# Coding_Journal
A coding journal is a personal record that developers use to document their coding process, track their learning, and share their experiences. It can be a physical notebook, a digital document, or even a blog. Stack Overflow Blog suggests writing in a journal at the start of each session to define goals, jotting down notes while coding, and summarizing finished tasks. Medium argues that a programming journal is valuable for personal knowledge, enhancing the learning process, and tracking progress.
